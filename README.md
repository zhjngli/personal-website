## Builds

1. Draft and review and publish at `/admin`
2. May need to reactivate the gatsby workspace
3. Builds in gatsby and netlify
    - Netlify generally faster due to better caching
    - Gatsby has nice diagnostics per build
4. When writing a post, `slug` is for linking the post, not a subtitle
