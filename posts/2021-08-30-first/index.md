I had actually created a blog/site for my technical documentation previously using Jekyll. It was powered by a theme called HydeJack, and it had a lot of features and a good design. I started it with the intention of writing more and doing more side projects and documenting those journeys, but it never got anywhere.

However, after setting that up, I didn't feel like I grokked the process of setting up a website and building out the html/css, any more than before I started. Simply because I took use of a preexisting theme and applied it to my own site. It didn't really feel like my own.

So, eventually I set out to build this new website, and a [photo website](https://zhjngli.com) too. I learned a lot more about react, webpack, postcss, typescript, javascript, and as I built this website, more about gatsby as well.

I honestly don't know that I'll have that much to say or to write about, but at least it's a start, and at least I learned a lot more about web development in the process.
