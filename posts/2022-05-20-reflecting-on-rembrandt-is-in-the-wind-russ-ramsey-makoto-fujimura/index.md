As I have been more and more drawn towards photography, I've also been grappling with questions of art. What draws us to beauty? What *is* beauty? Why does art so often invoke such powerful emotions? More personally, what am I saying through my photography? Do I have to be making any claim anyway?

*Rembrandt is in the Wind* helped me answer some of these questions, and inspired me to try and appreciate art even more. We often look at an artist's most famous work, whether Van Gogh's *Starry Night* or Michelangelo's *David*. More often than not, it's an artist's complete body of work, their life story, their inner sufferings, real life struggles, the lust for life, groaning for glory, and search of beauty that defines their art. Their art is a window into their soul, a way to more viscerally understand their deepest longings, how they saw glory and beauty, and how it reflected their own stories and experiences.

As a Christian, I especially appreciated how the vignettes of each artist were somehow connected to our faith. Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Tanner, Lilias, Vermeer, Hopper, were all connected somehow to faith, however tangentially. I've thought about my own experience with faith, particularly in the search for community, and how that might play out in my photography. It's definitely worth exploring more. The call to continuing creating, continue to appreciate beauty, and how that ties into our hunger for God's glory is particularly motivating. As I write this right before going to Italy, I'm excited for the new prospects with my photography, as well as the many opportunities to appreciate more artists, their stories, and ultimately God's beauty displayed through broken and redeemed characters.
